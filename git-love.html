    <p>
    I love the way you list the commits to a repository sorted alphabetically when I tell you git shortlog -s -n, it helps
    me remember exactly what changes I have made. And if that isn't enough, if I want to see just what changes I have made
    since yesterday, I just tell you git log --since=yesterday and you know exactly what I want. Pretty crazy. Did I mention I love
    how git remote show origin is enough to get you to show me where 'origin' is pointing to and also tracked branches, so beautiful.
  <br>

    One of the craziest things you have ever done was when you updated my local files from the github repository and all I said was
    $ git pull origin master. You're the best. If I want to ammend a new commit all I have to tell you is $ git commit --amend 'new commit message'
    or no message at all to keep the previous one. Finally, one of the coolest things you did for me this year was when you added all of my files
    to a git commit by just saying, $ git add -A. Wow! it sure has been a crazy time together, I don't really do much for you
    and you always do what I tell you. What a relationship.
