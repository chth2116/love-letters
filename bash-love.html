    <p>
      Just checked the *cal (display calender), and I noticed that todays *date is our anniversary. It's always so nice how you *locate
      all of the files I can't seem to find on my own; and if that wasn't enough I just give you a *cat and you display the contents of
      those files. What I love most is the way you display my name when I tell you *logname, so beautiful. Remember that one *time you showed
      me the program runtime? That was so fun! You're crazy. I just wanted to type *!! to do it all over again.
      </br></br>


      I also think it's pretty neat how every time I tell you *bzip2 you compress any file I wish into a zip. And if I don't want to list all
      of my files in a directory with *ls, I just tell you *dir to get a brief look at some of the files in the current directory. And if I'm ever
      in need, I can always count on you to display a calculator for me to use when I ask nicely with dc. We've had quite a ride together
      but it's time to start make a new directory with *mkdir and make some new memories/files with *touch.
