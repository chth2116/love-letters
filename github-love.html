  Oh github. Where do I even begin? This past week together has really been something. I hope you know that you have helped
  me stay so organized with all of my work. Every time I commit and push something to you, I know my work is in safe hands.
  If I'm ever in need of assitance, I just git help from you, you've always been there for me. And if that isn't enough, if I just
  want to add and commit something at the same time, I just tell you, git commit -am "Message". Honestly such a nice feature.
 </p>
  <p> Another great thing about you is the way you can remove my work I don't like from github, all I have to do is type git rm filename
    and you will take the file off of my repository. Oh, and one more thing I have to thank you for, thanks for making it super easy
    to move and rename files with a simple command. All I have to do is type, git mv filename dir/newFilename.
